# Patch Prompter

# Overview
Patch Prompter is a node-based workflow for generating text and image-based AI prompts. 

For similar examples of patch programming, see [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/), [vvvv](https://vvvv.org/), [Blender Geometry Nodes](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/introduction.html), [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max), or [ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/).

While ComfyUI seeks to build complex and repeatable workflows for local genAI models, Patch Prompter is a thin layer for creating batches that can be sent to any AI model, saved, and shared. An observability and human-in-the-loop feedback system will help with how the prompt systems are built, and ultimately will help create more beautiful images and moving pictures with AI, driven by artists.

## Impetus

Right now, artists have their own workflows and use their own models and trial-and-error to build text prompts to realize their vision with genAI systems. These techniques, often shared online, sometimes do not even reflect the way the underlying systems work. These prompts could be better, and artists should have better information about what works, and what doesn't, when realizing their visions through these new techniques.

# Use Case & Workflow
Identify the user or business workflow that would benefit from AI.
Clearly explain how AI improves or automates part of this process.

# AI Features to Be Implemented
- List and briefly describe the AI components you plan to include:
  - Prompt engineering
  - Structured outputs
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector databases
  - Evaluation frameworks
  - Observability tools
- Justify why each feature is relevant to your use case.

# Technical Approach
- Outline how the system would be built at a high level.
- Mention tools, models, or services you would use (e.g., LLM APIs, vector stores, Cursor).

# Example Prompts & Expected Outputs
- Include 1–2 sample prompts and describe the kind of responses your app would generate.
- Highlight any structured output or formatting strategies.

# Evaluation Strategy
- Briefly describe how you would assess your system’s effectiveness.
- Include any metrics or evaluation methods you would use.

# Observability Plan
- Note how you would track performance, errors, or usage patterns over time.

# Link to Proposal
- Upload your completed proposal as a README.md file in a public GitHub or BitBucket repo.
- Submit the link through the MBA Center under Week 7 - Project Week.
