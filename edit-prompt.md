*prompted by: Cameron Browning*

## prompt:

im going to upload a markdown thats a proposal for an app. I want you to read through it, and improve it for structure and succinctness, but do not remove or substantially change content. Make the changes, and also provide a report of what you've changed and why. The audience for this is both instructors at SectionAI (this is a mini-mba AI for programmers final project) and also executives at a prestigious design and animation studio with offices around the world that I think should fund the development of this wacko idea. The language should be informal and grokkable by non-technical executives, but also provide the meaningful AI stuff that will ensure this satisfies a more technical reviewer
